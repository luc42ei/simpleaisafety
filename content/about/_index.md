The "Simple AI Safety" team is Ethan, Markus, Arran and Omar.

We believe that there is good reason to believe that AI (artificial
intelligence) will have a severe negative impact on the world in the next years
or decades.

A big reason why these risks are being neglected is lack of awareness, in
particular by people with technical skills. If you are not already deep into AI
safety topics it can be quite hard to grasp the fundamental problems we are
facing. The aim of this site is providing solid intuitions for people with very
different backgrounds.
