# Basic

The orthogonality thesis is the belief that any level of intelligence can be 
paired with any final goal. Intelligence and goals are simply two separate things 
that don't have to depend on each other. An example is playing a video game where 
you can adjust two sliders: one for your character's intelligence and another 
for their moral values or goals. Cranking up the intelligence slider doesn't 
automatically move the goals slider to "good" or "evil." They are orthogonal, 
or independent of each other. In the context of AI, this implies that a system 
which has learned to pursue a certain goal will not realise that the goal is 
‘stupid’ or ‘unethical’ due to its intelligence.
